# VOICE-QUALITY-OF-TELECOM-ANALYSIS

The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify different types of call drops in a telecom network. This classification will allow operators to identify problem areas, optimize their networks, and improve the overall user experience.

In this project, we leverage machine learning (ML) techniques to predict and categorize call drop instances using a variety of features such as signal strength, network type, and geographical attributes. The implementation of a robust ML model like the Random Forest Classifier enables us to make accurate predictions based on historical data, helping telecom operators take proactive measures to improve their services.

Numerical Features:
o
Longitude and Latitude: Provide the geographical coordinates of the call drop.
o
Signal Strength: An essential parameter representing the quality of network service.
2.
Categorical Features:
o
Network Type: The type of network (e.g., 3G, 4G) under which the call was made.
o
Call Drop Category: A classification label indicating the type of call drop experienced.
o
State Name: Represents the region where the call drop occurred.

Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrated the application of machine learning to analyse and predict call drops in telecommunication networks. A Random Forest model was trained to classify call drop types, achieving a high level of accuracy. However, future work should focus on expanding the dataset and exploring alternative machine learning models to further improve performance.
